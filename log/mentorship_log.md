# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to hide API keys, imported my own Python module into another module, set PATH in Windows for python.exe and python scripts. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled configuring my windows machine to run python files and pip. I'm really glad that Youtube exist. I am worried a little bit that I am not making as much progress as the other mentees but I know that I am building a solid foundation and workflow that will benefit me in the long run.

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I made my first flask webpage. I am almost done with Microsoft VS Studio Flask tutorial I tried to launch the debugger and after hours of configuring it in VS Code I still didn't get the debugger to work. 

**Thoughts**: I don't understand everything but at least I'm better than when I started. Flask seems like it has the same concepts like React but not as dynmaic. Tomorrow I would like to see if I can incoporate material UI into this project or React :) I miss javascript.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I learned about templating with Flask. I learned how to pass values from the control into the view and I learned about templating inheritance. The hard lesson that I learned is that I need to use `{% endblock %}` instead of `{% end block %}` or you will run into errors. You should always but a space between percent sign and the context within the curly braces.

**Thoughts**: Things are running more smoothly since I configured my Windows 10 machine to run python at the command line. I still need to setup the debug in Flask it would mean that I can edit templates in real time. Right now I always have to kill the server.


**Notes** 

Definitions from Treehouse

`{% block %}`: This template tag defines a block in a template. In templates that are extended, these areas are overridable. In templates that extend other templates, this areas will override the parent template's block.

`{% extends %}`: This template tag specifies what template is the parent of the current template.

`{{ super() }}`: This function brings in whatever content was in the same block in the parent template. Very handy if you want to include the existing content but you want to insert new content before or after the old.

### Day 4: March 6, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Today I totally gave up out of frustration. I tried to follow another Treehouse tutorial about flask by creating a new vitural environment and I totally broke down crying. I decided I will take a break and figure things out in the morning.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes you just need to break the chain. I wasn't able to make a commit onto Github today. But I did break my 3 day streak. Celebrate the little wins.

##Day 6 : March 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Went through Travesty Media Intro Flask Tutorial. He is a great teacher.
I learned how to do for loops in Flask. Learned that Jinga is the templating engine for Flask.

Jinga templating rules

%% Percent symbols are logic

{{}} curly braces are varible or dynmaic value

Things to remember 

In case main app file does nto follow app.py convention 
use terminal command
`export FLASK_APP = name`
or `python NameOFAPP`

How to run flask via Visual Studio code `flask run`

**Thoughts**:
Things went smoothly so far. Just have to be careful with misspelling

##Day 7 : March 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I broke the chain. I went to the R Unconference this weekend. I learn so much about the importance of
file managment and creating descriptive documentation for projects. I also created my first R open source contribution. I also learned that I can use
Network Analysis to explore the Marvel API. 

I was able to create a unit test for a R package.

**Thoughts**:
It's nice going outside and meeting other nerds who are intersted in coding.
I learned a lot by being open mine and having a greate mentor. Coding gets easier once you've masted one language. 

Even though I have never created my own R function I was able to figure things out because programming foundation are the same. Variables, Data Structues, loops, and if statments in order to create a program.

I also learned that github clone https and ssh are not the same thing. In order to have seamless clone and editing to Github I have to make sure I use ssh option on the repository.

##Day 8 : March 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today is the final day of the R Unconference in Chicago. I created my first Shiny App. It wasn't so bad. The Shiny package is
heavily dependent on Javascript. And you know what I love Javascript.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad that I spent that money going to bootcamp to learn Javascript. Its a useful skill.

##Day 9 : March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Nothing much to report. I did not continue with Part 2 of Travesty Media tutorial of Flask because the instructor's computer setup is
completely different from my setup. So I decided to check out a different tutorial which is a CRUD book manager app. I learned `request` from the Flask package represents form data as `ImmutableMultiDict` - fancy python dictionary that stores info in a tuple. I also had to install flask sqlalchemy in my environment.

Learned that flask sqlalchemy is an ORM - Object Relational Mapping. It basically means that I can use Python objects to create SQL commands to create and manipulate a database.

**Thoughts**: It was a chill day. I didn't cry out of anguish today while coding.

##Day 10 : March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tutorial. Tomorrow I would like to try to create a crud app on my own. I also want learn more about SQL alchemy. 
I might check out some documentation tomorrow or look at data camp course to learn more. I also want to learn more about form methods, cookies, and caching.

**Thoughts**: Going through this tutorial made me realize some of the gaps that I have in my knowledge.

##Day 10 : March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a tutorial from Treehouse called Flasks basics. 
Learned what a cookie is and explored the Python json library.

A cookie is local storage for a website. It can't hold extensive data like a sql database but can store passwords, usernames
etc.

Response: A response is the data that the server, Flask, sends back to the client.

`make_response():` This function generates the entire response object that'll be sent back to the client, but lets you store it in a variable for further manipulation.

`response.set_cookie():` Sets a cookie on the response object. Takes name for the cookie and a value.

`json.dumps():` This method turns a Python data structure (list, string, dictionary, etc) into a JSON string.

`json.loads():` This method turns a JSON string into a Python object.

**Thoughts**: Going through this tutorial made me realize some of the gaps that I have in my knowledge.

**Thoughts**: I really want to learn more about sessions, sessions keys, using json in python, serializations, and cookies
