# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to hide API keys, imported my own Python module into another module, set PATH in Windows for python.exe and python scripts. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled configuring my windows machine to run python files and pip. I'm really glad that Youtube exist. I am worried a little bit that I am not making as much progress as the other mentees but I know that I am building a solid foundation and workflow that will benefit me in the long run.

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I made my first flask webpage. I am almost done with Microsoft VS Studio Flask tutorial I tried to launch the debugger and after hours of configuring it in VS Code I still didn't get the debugger to work. 

**Thoughts**: I don't understand everything but at least I'm better than when I started. Flask seems like it has the same concepts like React but not as dynmaic. Tomorrow I would like to see if I can incoporate material UI into this project or React :) I miss javascript.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I learned about templating with Flask. I learned how to pass values from the control into the view and I learned about templating inheritance. The hard lesson that I learned is that I need to use `{% endblock %}` instead of `{% end block %}` or you will run into errors. You should always but a space between percent sign and the context within the curly braces.

**Thoughts**: Things are running more smoothly since I configured my Windows 10 machine to run python at the command line. I still need to setup the debug in Flask it would mean that I can edit templates in real time. Right now I always have to kill the server.


**Notes** 

Definitions from Treehouse

`{% block %}`: This template tag defines a block in a template. In templates that are extended, these areas are overridable. In templates that extend other templates, this areas will override the parent template's block.

`{% extends %}`: This template tag specifies what template is the parent of the current template.

`{{ super() }}`: This function brings in whatever content was in the same block in the parent template. Very handy if you want to include the existing content but you want to insert new content before or after the old.

### Day 4: March 6, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Today I totally gave up out of frustration. I tried to follow another Treehouse tutorial about flask by creating a new vitural environment and I totally broke down crying. I decided I will take a break and figure things out in the morning.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes you just need to break the chain. I wasn't able to make a commit onto Github today. But I did break my 3 day streak. Celebrate the little wins.
