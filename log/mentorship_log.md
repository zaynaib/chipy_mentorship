# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to hide API keys, imported my own Python module into another module, set PATH in Windows for python.exe and python scripts. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled configuring my windows machine to run python files and pip. I'm really glad that Youtube exist. I am worried a little bit that I am not making as much progress as the other mentees but I know that I am building a solid foundation and workflow that will benefit me in the long run.
