# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to hide API keys, imported my own Python module into another module, set PATH in Windows for python.exe and python scripts. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled configuring my windows machine to run python files and pip. I'm really glad that Youtube exist. I am worried a little bit that I am not making as much progress as the other mentees but I know that I am building a solid foundation and workflow that will benefit me in the long run.

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I made my first flask webpage. I am almost done with Microsoft VS Studio Flask tutorial I tried to launch the debugger and after hours of configuring it in VS Code I still didn't get the debugger to work. 

**Thoughts**: I don't understand everything but at least I'm better than when I started. Flask seems like it has the same concepts like React but not as dynmaic. Tomorrow I would like to see if I can incoporate material UI into this project or React :) I miss javascript.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I learned about templating with Flask. I learned how to pass values from the control into the view and I learned about templating inheritance. The hard lesson that I learned is that I need to use {% endblock %} instead of {% end block %} or you will run into erros.

**Thoughts**: Things are running more smoothly since I configured my Windows 10 machine to run python at the command line. I still need to setup the debug in Flask it would mean that I can edit templates in real time. Right now I always have to kill the server.
