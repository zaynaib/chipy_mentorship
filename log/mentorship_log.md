# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to hide API keys, imported my own Python module into another module, set PATH in Windows for python.exe and python scripts. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled configuring my windows machine to run python files and pip. I'm really glad that Youtube exist. I am worried a little bit that I am not making as much progress as the other mentees but I know that I am building a solid foundation and workflow that will benefit me in the long run.

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I made my first flask webpage. I am almost done with Microsoft VS Studio Flask tutorial I tried to launch the debugger and after hours of configuring it in VS Code I still didn't get the debugger to work. 

**Thoughts**: I don't understand everything but at least I'm better than when I started. Flask seems like it has the same concepts like React but not as dynmaic. Tomorrow I would like to see if I can incoporate material UI into this project or React :) I miss javascript.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Today I learned about templating with Flask. I learned how to pass values from the control into the view and I learned about templating inheritance. The hard lesson that I learned is that I need to use `{% endblock %}` instead of `{% end block %}` or you will run into errors. You should always but a space between percent sign and the context within the curly braces.

**Thoughts**: Things are running more smoothly since I configured my Windows 10 machine to run python at the command line. I still need to setup the debug in Flask it would mean that I can edit templates in real time. Right now I always have to kill the server.


**Notes** 

Definitions from Treehouse

`{% block %}`: This template tag defines a block in a template. In templates that are extended, these areas are overridable. In templates that extend other templates, this areas will override the parent template's block.

`{% extends %}`: This template tag specifies what template is the parent of the current template.

`{{ super() }}`: This function brings in whatever content was in the same block in the parent template. Very handy if you want to include the existing content but you want to insert new content before or after the old.

### Day 4: March 6, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Today I totally gave up out of frustration. I tried to follow another Treehouse tutorial about flask by creating a new vitural environment and I totally broke down crying. I decided I will take a break and figure things out in the morning.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes you just need to break the chain. I wasn't able to make a commit onto Github today. But I did break my 3 day streak. Celebrate the little wins.

##Day 6 : March 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Went through Travesty Media Intro Flask Tutorial. He is a great teacher.
I learned how to do for loops in Flask. Learned that Jinga is the templating engine for Flask.

Jinga templating rules

%% Percent symbols are logic

{{}} curly braces are varible or dynmaic value

Things to remember 

In case main app file does nto follow app.py convention 
use terminal command
`set FLASK_APP = name`
or `python NameOFAPP`

How to run flask via Visual Studio code `flask run`

**Thoughts**:
Things went smoothly so far. Just have to be careful with misspelling

##Day 7 : March 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I broke the chain. I went to the R Unconference this weekend. I learn so much about the importance of
file managment and creating descriptive documentation for projects. I also created my first R open source contribution. I also learned that I can use
Network Analysis to explore the Marvel API. 

I was able to create a unit test for a R package.

**Thoughts**:
It's nice going outside and meeting other nerds who are intersted in coding.
I learned a lot by being open mine and having a greate mentor. Coding gets easier once you've masted one language. 

Even though I have never created my own R function I was able to figure things out because programming foundation are the same. Variables, Data Structues, loops, and if statments in order to create a program.

I also learned that github clone https and ssh are not the same thing. In order to have seamless clone and editing to Github I have to make sure I use ssh option on the repository.

##Day 8 : March 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today is the final day of the R Unconference in Chicago. I created my first Shiny App. It wasn't so bad. The Shiny package is
heavily dependent on Javascript. And you know what I love Javascript.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad that I spent that money going to bootcamp to learn Javascript. Its a useful skill.

##Day 9 : March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Nothing much to report. I did not continue with Part 2 of Travesty Media tutorial of Flask because the instructor's computer setup is
completely different from my setup. So I decided to check out a different tutorial which is a CRUD book manager app. I learned `request` from the Flask package represents form data as `ImmutableMultiDict` - fancy python dictionary that stores info in a tuple. I also had to install flask sqlalchemy in my environment.

Learned that flask sqlalchemy is an ORM - Object Relational Mapping. It basically means that I can use Python objects to create SQL commands to create and manipulate a database.

**Thoughts**: It was a chill day. I didn't cry out of anguish today while coding.

##Day 10 : March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tutorial. Tomorrow I would like to try to create a crud app on my own. I also want learn more about SQL alchemy. 
I might check out some documentation tomorrow or look at data camp course to learn more. I also want to learn more about form methods, cookies, and caching.

**Thoughts**: Going through this tutorial made me realize some of the gaps that I have in my knowledge.

##Day 10 : March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a tutorial from Treehouse called Flasks basics. 
Learned what a cookie is and explored the Python json library.

A cookie is local storage for a website. It can't hold extensive data like a sql database but can store passwords, usernames
etc.

Response: A response is the data that the server, Flask, sends back to the client.

`make_response():` This function generates the entire response object that'll be sent back to the client, but lets you store it in a variable for further manipulation.

`response.set_cookie():` Sets a cookie on the response object. Takes name for the cookie and a value.

`json.dumps():` This method turns a Python data structure (list, string, dictionary, etc) into a JSON string.

`json.loads():` This method turns a JSON string into a Python object.

**Thoughts**: Going through this tutorial made me realize some of the gaps that I have in my knowledge.

## Day 11 : March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished teamtreehouse Flask basics tutorial today! Created an app that dresses up a bear.


**Thoughts**: I really want to learn more about sessions, sessions keys, using json in python, serializations, and cookies

## Day 12 : March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a tutorial from Treehouse called Flasks basics. 
Learned what a cookie is and explored the Python json library.


**Thoughts**: Going through this tutorial made me realize some of the gaps that I have in my knowledge.

**Next Steps:** Explore comic vine api and environment variables in python

## Day  16: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Took a Break


## Day 17 : March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Took another Break


## Day 18 : March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I got through chapters 1 and 2 of Flask Mega Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg

**Thoughts**: I'm still confused about environmental variables. Apparently there is this python package called DotEnv that allows a user to control them. I need to do more research on it. In the Flask Mega tutorial you can run the microblog app by doing  `set FLASK_APP=microblog.py flask run ` which I found interesting. My other flask apps I was apply to run them by calling `python myapp.py` . I guess its just the way that Miguel structures his app.

**Next Steps:**  Learn more about environmental variables

## Day 19 : March 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got through the Flask Mega tutorial 3 -4 Web forms and Databases. Learned about a concept called Seperation of Concerns which is another term for making your program more modular. You are breaking up your program into different distinct tasks. For example in the Flask Mega tutorial we have a scripts for intializing, database models, routes, and forms so far. These are distinct tasks.

Also learned more about serect keys for Flask sessions.
A **secret key** that will be used for securely signing the session cookie and can be used for any other security related needs by extensions or your application. 

 app.config.from_object('config') in your init.py file. Then all the configuration values will be loaded into the app.config dictionary.


**Thoughts**:  This tutorial is really boring but informative.

**Next Steps:**  Tutorial parts 5-6

##Day:??? March 23,2019

##Study straegy
I have a Lenovo Legion gaming laptop. I also play pc games. You don’t need a gaming laptop to code. I use Leet Code to practice my algorithms. I focus on one algorithm until i can explain its solution fluently. I write my solutions over and over on a whiteboard until i can remember them by heart. I start with simple small algorithms then work my way up to tougher ones. Remembering how to solve smaller algorithms helps me in my approach to tougher ones. I also solicit feedback from the coding community.


##Day:??? March 25,2019
export FLASK_DEBUG=1

##Day?? March 27,2019
Got done with another python course about databases. Created another basic crud app this time with diary entries instead of forms. Learned about the peewee database. Its a much smaller easier to work with database than sqlAlchemy.
