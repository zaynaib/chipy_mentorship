I am exploring the Marvel API 

Details about Authorizing a call to the Marvel API can be found here.

Authentication for Server-Side Applications
Server-side applications must pass two parameters in addition to the apikey parameter:

ts - a timestamp (or other long string which can change on a request-by-request basis)
hash - a md5 digest of the ts parameter, your private key and your public key (e.g. md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)
For example, a user with a public key of "1234" and a private key of "abcd" could construct a valid call as follows: http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics?ts=1&apikey=1234&hash=ffd275c5130566a2916217b101f26150 (the hash value is the md5 digest of 1abcd1234)
