## ChiPy Mentorship

Welcome to my Github Repo.
I am currently doing a mentorship with the Chicago Python Users Group referred to as the ChiPy Mentorship program.
I am in the Spring 2019 cohort of this mentorship which is schedule to end sometime in May 2019.
This repo is a play ground for any Python projects that I may create in order to solidfy my knowledge of the language.
If you want to check out the status of my journey refer to the log folder.
